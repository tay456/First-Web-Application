# First-Web-Application

Currently working on a project where I have thought of a web application, designed it using wire frames and then started
to build it using HTML , CSS, JavaScript, node.js, Express web framework. 

The application is being built as responsive using flex-box. It is a tv-show/movie ratings app. Users should be able 
to:
 add a tv-show or movie 
 rate it
 search for a movie/tv-show and view it's rating 
 view movies/tv-shows by genre 

The idea is to have the tv-show/movie data stored in a mongodb.

Also want to add a feature of having the application connect with a API
